# qt-plotting-icons
![Design Preview](/preview.png)

This icons are made as a replacement for the previous icons used by the new Qt graphics toolkit that ships with the upcoming Octave 4.0. At the moment Octave uses the Tango icon set that misses a lot of icons that are usefull for Octave. Since I found a lot of joy in creating the icons thus far I'm going to add more icons in the future (not restriced to the plotting figure).

These icons are released under the GPLv3, check the license file inside this repository for more information.
